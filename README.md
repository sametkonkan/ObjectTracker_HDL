## ðŸ“œ ABSTRACT
This study extends the capabilities of a 2-D FFT-based object tracking algorithm to dynamically
optimize Region of Interest (ROI) and improve edge detection accuracy by integrating Contrast
Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). The improvements address issues with
edge detection noise, especially from background elements like clouds, and enhance the
robustness of object tracking. Adjustments include restructuring workspace handling,
eliminating redundant assignments, and refining the initialization process
